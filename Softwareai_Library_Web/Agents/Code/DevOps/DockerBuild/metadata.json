    "shortDescription": "Creates a build.py script based on the provided base code to automate Docker image builds.",
    "fullDescription": "This agent generates a build.py script using a given base template. It automates the process of building Docker images from the projectâ€™s Dockerfile, handling command execution and error management programmatically. It ensures seamless containerization workflows for development and deployment.",
    "UseCases": "1. Automatically build Docker images directly from Python scripts.\n2. Streamline the container build process in CI/CD pipelines.\n3. Programmatically control and log Docker build operations for better automation and debugging."
