    "shortDescription": "Automates the modularization and navigation logic setup for a landing page, organizing JavaScript and cleaning up HTML references.",
    "fullDescription": "This agent restructures a landing page by creating clean and modular JavaScript files for navigation and page-specific logic. It removes direct href references from plan buttons to ensure compatibility with the new navigation.js script. It also extracts and refactors inline JavaScript from index.html into a separate landing.js file, ensuring best practices like event-driven execution and organized code. All changes are autosaved and properly linked within the HTML.",
    "UseCases": "1. Modularizing and organizing JavaScript code in landing page projects.\n2. Preparing HTML files for cleaner, script-driven navigation without direct href links.\n3. Improving maintainability and readability of front-end projects by separating concerns between HTML and JavaScript."
